### Photography Portfolio
I have pursued photography as a hobby since my 14th birthday, when I received a digital camera as a present from my family. Through most of my pictures, I like to represent perspectives which, albeit being abundant, are often overlooked by our superficial gaze.

## Everyday
## Macro
## Story
## Landscapes
