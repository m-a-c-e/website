### 3D Simulation
- Rendering using OpenGL and multi-threading using std::threads in C++
- The physics of the sphere is such that the UAVs are attracted to the surface of the sphere
- The UAVs perform random motion while also colliding with each other
- The velocities and acceleration of each UAV is controlled by its own thread
- Incoroporated thread-saftey and collision detection across threads
