During my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering, I always enjoyed across multiple-disciplines of engineering. To gain further exposre, I decided to pursue Masters in Robotics at Georgia Insittute of Technology with focus on AI, Computer Vision and Mechatronics. Feel free to checkout my github and some of the cool videos from my past projects by navigating from the topmost tabs. Thank you for visiting. Hope to see you again!
