During my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering, I always enjoyed across multiple-disciplines of engineering. To gain further exposure, I decided to pursue Masters in Robotics at Georgia Insittute of Technology with focus on AI, Computer Vision and Mechatronics. I am also interested in High Performance Computing as I believe most of the algorithms for robotics are run on embedded hardware where time complexity is a major bottlenek. Feel free to checkout my github and some of the cool videos from my past projects by navigating from the topmost tabs. Thank you for visiting. Hope to see you again!
